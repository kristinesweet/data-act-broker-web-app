#### May 10, 2017

On September 30, 2016, we released the full version of the DATA Act Broker that contains everything agencies need to test the data validation and submission process. We continue to make improvements to the Broker and respond to issues discovered through agency use.

In this release of the Broker, we rolled out functionality improvements for the cross-file validation processing time and a disabled upload button for users without upload or certify permissions.
